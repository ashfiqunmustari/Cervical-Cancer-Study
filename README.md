**Cervical Cancer Cell Classification: Research Repository**

This repository contains a dataset, code, and documentation related to the research on **"Explainable AI for Medical Imaging: A Deep Learning
Approach towards Classification of Cervical Cancer"**. The study explores our proposed methodologies, such as transfer learning, cost-effective learning, supervised contrastive learning, and explainable AI, to enhance medical imaging analysis.

**Overview**
This study focuses on building an efficient system for classifying cervical cancer cells using deep learning techniques. 
The repository includes:
**1.** The complete undergraduate thesis detailing the methodology and findings.
**2.** The conference paper published in IEEE Xplore and presented at ICCIT 2023.
**3.** Code implementing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve interpretability and trust in AI systems.
**4.** A dataset of annotated cervical cancer cell images used for training and testing.
This work is particularly valuable for researchers and practitioners in the fields of cervical cancer studies, medical image analysis, and AI research.
**Results**
The proposed system achieved a 97.29% classification accuracy on the SIPaKMeD dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance for cervical cancer cell classification.
